    "1. The function first initializes four quantum registers: `ab`, `cd`, `anc`, and a classical register `c` using the `QuantumRegister` and `ClassicalRegister` classes from the Qiskit\n",
    "library. The `ab`, `cd`, and `anc` registers each have two qubits, and the `c` register has two classical bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A quantum circuit is created using the `QuantumCircuit` class from the Qiskit library, and the previously created registers are passed to the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `RY` gates are applied to the `ab` and `cd` qubits. The angles of the gates are computed using the numpy library, where the arcsine of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` is \n",
    "multiplied by two.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The swap circuit is then applied to the `anc`, `ab`, and `cd` qubits. The `H` (Hadamard) gate is applied to the `anc` register. The `cswap` (controlled swap) gate is applied between `anc[0]` and `ab[0], ab[1]` and between `anc[1]` and `cd[0], cd[1]`. Finally, the `H` gate is applied again to the `anc` register.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The ancilla qubits are then measured using the `measure` method of the quantum circuit. The measurement is stored in the `c` classical register.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The circuit is executed using the `execute` method, which takes the quantum circuit, a backend (`qasm_simulator` in this case), and the number of shots (`1024` in this case) as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The results of the execution are obtained using the `result` method, and the counts of the measurement outcomes are obtained using the `get_counts` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The probabilities of obtaining the `00` result for the `anc` qubits are calculated using the counts obtained in step 7, and the result is returned as a floating-point number."
